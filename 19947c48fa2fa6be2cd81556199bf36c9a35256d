Session prompts:

1. Initial request:
'Ok. A new endpoint has been built into the units resolver that gets units with work orders in it. The code is deployed, but not working. Could you:
1. Review the code with the typescript rules in your memory, and adjust the code as needed. Make sure the code lints and formats properly.
2. Review the appsync configuration in the terraform directory and make sure it follows all the terraform rules in your memory.
3. Deploy and changes and test the deployment.'

2. Tasks completed:
- Fixed TypeScript compliance issues by removing any types and fixing strict boolean checks
- Fixed linting errors by removing unnecessary async/await and proper type assertions
- Created .eslintignore file to exclude dist and test files
- Reviewed Terraform configuration (which was already correct)
- Fixed authorization token extraction bug (was adding Bearer prefix twice)
- Successfully deployed and tested the getUnitWithWorkOrders endpoint

3. Final request:
'ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR.'
